# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Web UI Frontend service that connects to the existing Haskell AI chatbot backend. The frontend will be built using TypeScript, React, Vite, and pnpm, providing users with an intuitive chat interface to interact with the OpenAI-powered chatbot service.

The backend already provides a REST API with endpoints for chat interactions (`/api/chat`) and health checks (`/health`), along with session management capabilities. The frontend needs to consume these APIs and provide a modern, responsive chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to the AI chatbot through a web interface, so that I can have conversations without using the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a message in the input field THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat history
2. WHEN the user clicks the send button or presses Enter THEN the system SHALL send the message to the backend API at `/api/chat`
3. WHEN the API responds successfully THEN the system SHALL display the AI response in the chat history
4. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user
5. IF the input field is empty THEN the system SHALL NOT allow sending the message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the conversation history in a chat-like interface, so that I can follow the flow of the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order
2. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish between user messages and AI responses
3. WHEN new messages are added THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
4. WHEN the conversation becomes long THEN the system SHALL maintain a scrollable chat history
5. WHEN a message is being sent THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to maintain session continuity, so that the AI remembers our previous conversation context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new conversation THEN the system SHALL send `sessionId: null` to create a new session
2. WHEN the backend returns a sessionId THEN the system SHALL store and use it for subsequent messages
3. WHEN sending follow-up messages THEN the system SHALL include the current sessionId in the request
4. WHEN the session is established THEN the system SHALL maintain it throughout the conversation
5. IF the session becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and start a new session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and modern chat interface, so that I can use it comfortably on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-width chat interface
2. WHEN accessing the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens
3. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL use modern UI components with proper styling
4. WHEN interacting with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for user actions
5. WHEN the application is idle THEN the system SHALL maintain a clean and professional appearance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the connection status with the backend, so that I know if the service is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check the backend health endpoint at `/health`
2. WHEN the backend is available THEN the system SHALL display a connected status indicator
3. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a disconnected status and disable chat functionality
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
5. IF the connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically re-enable the chat functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to be built with modern development practices, so that it's maintainable and follows TypeScript best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL define interfaces that match the backend API schema
3. WHEN handling state THEN the system SHALL use React hooks appropriately
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL use Vite with SWC for fast compilation
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use pnpm as the package manager

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to clear the conversation history, so that I can start fresh conversations when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a clear button THEN the system SHALL remove all messages from the chat history
2. WHEN clearing the conversation THEN the system SHALL reset the session to start a new one
3. WHEN the conversation is cleared THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation or feedback message
4. WHEN starting a new conversation after clearing THEN the system SHALL send `sessionId: null` to the backend
5. IF there are no messages to clear THEN the system SHALL disable or hide the clear button

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see when the AI is typing/processing my message, so that I know the system is working on my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is sent to the backend THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator
2. WHEN the AI response is received THEN the system SHALL hide the typing indicator
3. WHEN the request takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL continue showing the typing indicator
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL hide the typing indicator and show the error
5. IF multiple messages are sent quickly THEN the system SHALL handle the typing indicators appropriately
